            SPO Token
          </Typography>
          <Typography align='justify' paragraph>
            SPO is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between
            participants on the Spores platform in a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing SPO is to provide a
            convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem
            on the Spores platform, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public
            (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it
            designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not
            exclusively provided by the issuer. SPO does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation,
            right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other
            company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will SPO entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends,
            revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any
            relevant jurisdiction. SPO may only be utilised on the Spores platform, and ownership of SPO carries no
            rights, express or implied, other than the right to use SPO as a means to enable usage of and interaction
            within the Spores platform.
          </Typography>
          <Typography align='justify' paragraph>
            SPO also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to contribute to and
            participate in the ecosystem on the Spores platform, thereby creating a win-win system where every
            participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. SPO is an integral and indispensable part of the Spores
            platform, because without SPO, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in
            activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the Spores platform. Given that
            additional SPO will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on the
            Spores platform, users of the Spores platform and/or holders of SPO which did not actively participate will
            not receive any SPO incentives.
